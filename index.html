    <p>
      Critical thinking involves active involvement. You are not passively accepting everything that you read or hear but are questioning, evaluating, categorising information and making connections within the text and comparing what the author is
      saying with other experts who have written on the same topic.At university you are asked to think critically when you read academic texts, when you write academic assignments and when you present in tutorials or seminars.

    <p style="font-size:20px; color:mintcream; font-family:Times New Roman; text-align:left;">Safety is one of the major concerning issues for all automobile users as crashes caused by human intervention vehicles are responsible to 1.25 million
      deaths per year. Driving vehicles under human influence possesses risk factors, such as speeding,
      driving under the influence of alcohol and drugs, not fastening seat belts or child restraints and unsafe road infrastructure. AIVs has the potential to minimize global road traffic accidents as it features some of the most innovative
      technology.
      Chief executive officer of Tesla, Elon Musk, states that AIVs could decrease the chance of fatal road accidents up to 50 percent if the vehicle is driven in autopilot mode (McGoogan, 2016). The AIVs are initially installed with large amount of
      data
      and features advanced sensor coverage to recognize its surroundings. For instance, all the concepts of Tesla's AV are equipped with eight surround cameras that provides 360 degrees of perceptibility at up to 250 meters of range, twelve
      ultrasonic
      sensors enhance this vision by detecting hard and soft objects at nearly twice the distance of the prior system and a front-aligned radar with enhanced processing provides additional information on a redundant wavelength and has the ability to
      detect
      roads and objects through heavy rain, fog or even any vehicles ahead (Tesla, 2018).</p>

    <p style="font-size:20px; color:mintcream; font-family:Times New Roman; text-align:left;">Experts believe that the AIVs could enhance the lifestyle of people dramatically. As hiring drivers could be expensive, self-driving are often found to be
      stressful. As AIVs possesses autopilot feature, children, disabled people and inexperienced
      drivers would be able to travel without any stress and would also allow the passengers to interact in other productive work whilst in pursuit. Furthermore, locating parking spots are often difficult in the big cities especially during office
      hours
      and could be unpleasant (Sparkes, 2014). Such stress leaves no option for the owners but to use public transport instead of their own vehicle (Gadepalli &Vaid). But the AIVs could locate its own parking and spare additional time that would
      have
      gone waste while parking human-intervention cars. Moreover, Uber has planned to build its own fleet of AI-SUVs by 2021 to eliminate risks and human threats. However, mass production of AIVs could create a tension over drivers as it might
      result
      in drop of driving-employment on a large scale. But on the other hand, production of AIVs consists of designing and assembling high tech materials and require unique skills. Such requirement on manufacturing and maintain AIVs could create more
      employments
      for undergraduates or college degree holders on automobile and IT platforms(Sparkes, 2014).</p>

  <div id="Impacts-on-the-Environment" class="tabcontent">
    <p style="font-size:20px; color:mintcream; font-family:Times New Roman; text-align:left;">Tackling the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) has become a global concerning issue. Australia itself was accounted for 85 percent of GHG emission from
      its road transport sector where 46 percent were caused from cars in 2015 (Climate Council, 2016).
      Many international organizations have come to an agreement to reduce GHG in climate by outlawing the sale of fuel-powered cars in distant future and to sell electric or hybrid cars. Moreover, mass production of vehicles requires electricity
      which
      indeed pollutes the air. Since AIVs are electric powered vehicle and consists of battery, they would not produce any GHG and thus, decrease the further increase of GHG emission (Bews, 2018). Moreover, Tesla has created an automated ongoing
      calculation
      on its website which depicts the amount of carbon emission saved around the world, current rate 2988841.70 tons approximately, by Tesla's vehicle where the amount of carbon emission saved is increasing steadily. Intelligence Transportation
      Society
      of America published a report on Intelligence Transportation System and stated that replacing human-intervention vehicle with AIVs could decrease fuel consumption by about 2 to 4 percent which could be a possible to decrease the rate of GHG
      emission
      to the atmosphere.</p>
