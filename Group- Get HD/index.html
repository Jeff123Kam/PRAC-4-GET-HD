   <p>
     Critical thinking involves active involvement. You are not passively accepting everything that you read or hear but are questioning, evaluating, categorising information and making connections within the text and comparing what the author is saying with other experts who have written on the same topic.At university you are asked to think critically when you read academic texts, when you write academic assignments and when you present in  tutorials or seminars.
