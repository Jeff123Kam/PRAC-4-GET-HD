          <h2>Critical thinking is a tool for decision making</h2>
          <p class="support">
            Weighing up alternatives in order to make decisions is part of the critical thinking process. For example, think about the  following activities and ask yourself what strategies you would use to come to a decision.

          <h2>What does critical thinking involve</h2>
          <p class="support">
          Critical thinking involves active involvement. You are not passively accepting everything that you read or hear but are questioning, evaluating, categorising information and making connections within the text and comparing what the author is saying with other experts who have written on the same topic.

          <h2>Reading Critical</h2>
          <p class="support">
          One of the key strategies you can use when reading critically is to ask yourself a series of questions. Begin by asking questions which relate to the text overall and then look at the authorâ€™s argument and the evidence used to support it.
